## Running service locally
---

### Prerequisites

1. [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

2. [install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

> **_Note:_** if using Mac, docker desktop for Mac includes docker-compose out of the box so no need to install separately.

### Run through setup script

1. clone this repo

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tseporamaisa/redash_poc.git
```   
2. change into project directory

```bash
   cd redash_poc
```
3. run redash service

```bash
   bash setup.sh start
```
